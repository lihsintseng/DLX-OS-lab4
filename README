How to build my solution:
-- Execute make in corresponding directories.
   Problem 1-6:
      make run in flat/os/
      creating file system:    make & make run in flat/apps/fdisk
      testing problem 4 & 6:   make & make run in flat/apps/ostests
      format file system:      make & make run in flat/apps/fdisk
      testing multiprocesses:  make & make run in flat/apps/example

   Problem 7:
      make run in multilevel/os/
      creating file system:    make & make run in multilevel/apps/fdisk
      testing functions:       make & make run in multilevel/apps/ostests
      testing multiprocesses:  make & make run in multilevel/apps/example
